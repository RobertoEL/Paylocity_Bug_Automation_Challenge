**Title:** 
Banner takes User inside without proper login


**Description:**
From the login page, if the Paylocity Banner is clicked the user is redirected to the table page. It does not display any data, just the column names and the Add Employee button. The button prompts the Add Employee window although does not allow to add any entries.


**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Go to https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login
2. Click the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard banner on top of the screen (Note: do not login)
3. The page will load a version of the Employees table page without any entries.
4. Furthermore, the User can interact with the Add Employee button and open the Add Employee window.


**Expected result:**
If the user is not logged in, the banner should not redirect the user to the table page. It should redirect back to the Login page.


**Actual result:**
The user is redirected to the Employees table page without loggin in first.
