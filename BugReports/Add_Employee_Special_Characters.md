**Title:** 
Add Employee window accepts any character


**Description:**
A user is able to enter any character to the First Name and Last Name fields in the Add Employee window, and save it.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Go to https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login
2. Login.
3. Click the Add Employee button.
4. Enter any string with special characters in it, but less than 51 characters, in the First Name and Last Name fields.
5. Add a number from 0 to 32 in the Dependents field.
6. Click the Add button.
7. The entry is added to the table.


**Expected result:**
A user should not be able to enter any character in the Name fields, as this could end up in spam of nonsense entries.


**Actual result:**
Both, the First Name and Last Name fields, should only allow characters found in actual names, and not accept special characters.
